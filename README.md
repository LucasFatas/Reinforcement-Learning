# Reinforcement Learning
In this assignment we programed an algorithm to teach a robot to navigate a maze and find a target based on reinforcement learning (RL). The target location is a rewarded location in that maze, and the robot learned to navigate from a fixed start to this rewarded target by exploration and repetition. We used Q-Learning, a form of RL to achieve this.
